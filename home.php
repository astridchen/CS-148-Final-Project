<p>A sigil is a sentence expressing your deepest desire which you then turn into a symbolic picture, fill with energy then forget about - and wait to see if your deepest wish comes true.

Unlike complicated magical rituals, you will need:

A pen or pencil.

A piece of paper.

Process:

Write down your desire or a statement of intent

Turn it into a picture (a sigil)

Simplify that picture, enhance the aesthetic of the sigil it shouldn't be a doodle

Charge the picture up with magical energy

Ground yourself, erase the sigil from your memory - confident that the sigil is now in your unconscious which is going to do all the magical work for you.

<p>By definition a sigil is a symbol with mystical significance deriving from the Latin term sigillum, meaning seal, it serves as a represenation of a desired outcome.

In magical terms, a sigil is a tool - it's a shape you design that tricks your mind into magicking a specific effect into your life. Creating sigils to work magic was made popular by the strange and mystical artist Austin Osman Spare. He said:

"Sigils are... a means of symbolising desire and giving it a form that prevents thought on that particular desire... and allows it free passage to the sub-consciousness."

- A.O.Spare, "The Book Of Pleasure"</p>
